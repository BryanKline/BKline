Brief:

Folders contain programming projects and code samples as well as my resume and 
my UNR transcripts.

Detailed:

The folders here contain coding projects, in a number of different languages,
both as assignments for school and as personal projects, including one small
project produced for an organization for practical purposes.  In addition to
that a brief resume and university transcripts
are all included. 

Most folders contain README.txt files like this one that describe the contents 
of the folder or its children folders.  The coding projects are also accompanied
by README files describing the project or code sample and almost all code is
extensively commented, though not all code is commented following the same 
standards.

All code was written exclusively and entirely by me unless otherwise indicated in
the few cases when code was provided by a professor or when code was produced as a
group project.  When poor coding standards and practices are evident or where bugs 
are present they are retained as artifacts here for the purposes of demonstrating 
the evolution of my computer science and engineering education at the University
of Nevada Reno (UNR).
