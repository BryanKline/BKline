Anti-Frogger

Brief:

Web browser arcade style game produced for school project with another student. 

Detailed:

This is a web browser based arcade style game created as a final project for
CS135, Introduction to C/C++.  The game was written primarily for Mozilla Firefox
and Chrome in Javascript in collaboration with another student, Dalton Navalta.

The game is a twist on the arcade game Frogger, but instead of the point of the
game being to get the frog to safety, the point is to drive a car over as many
frogs as possible. 

The player is a car whose objective is to run over frogs, being as they are in the 
game an invasive species, to stay on the road, to avoid collisions with other 
vehicles, and to avoid police who can pull you over.  The game consists of three 
levels and has music and sound effects.  For ease of game play, this version requires 
the player to hit only one frog in order to move to the next level, in the "real"
version of the game however the player is require to hit an increasing number of
frogs to advance.

The .html file is the game which will open a browser and the .js file is the
source code. The audio and image folders are assets the game needs to run
and the Screenshots and Presentation folder contains screenshots of the game
as well as a presentation which describes the game and development process.
