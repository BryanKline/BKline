Brief:

Class header and implementation files for a templated stack and queue, as 
well as a main driver that uses them to implement depth first and breadth 
first searches. 

Detailed:

Class header and implementation files for a templated stack and queue, which
inherit from a list class, supporting push and pop and enqueue and dequeue 
functionality, in order to implement depth first and breadth first graph search 
algorithms.  The graph implementation (VertexType) was provided by the professor.  
Folder PA11 contains the entire project.
