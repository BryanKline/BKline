Recursive Backtracking

Brief:

Main driver to implement functionality to recursively backtrack to find the
best fit for classes of various sizes to rooms of various capacities.

Detailed:

Free functions in the main driver implement functionality to use a recursive
backtracking algorithm to find the best fit for (school) classes of various sizes
to rooms of various capacities, simulating the way in which a university might
find classrooms for all the courses it has scheduled for a given semester.  The
class (ClassType) and room (RoomType) classes are provided by the professor.  
Folder PA08 contains the entire project.
