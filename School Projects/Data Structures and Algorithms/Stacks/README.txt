Stacks

Brief:

Folders contain two different types of stack implementations, array
based and node based.

Detailed:

The folders contain two different stack implementations, array based
and node based.  The array based has itself two different implementations,
one where the top of the stack moves and the other where it stays put and
the rest of the stack moves relative to it.  The node based stack is 
essentially a linked list.  Both implementations support push and pop as 
well as overloaded operators for assignment and equality.
