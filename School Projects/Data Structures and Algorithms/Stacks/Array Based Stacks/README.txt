Brief:

Two different array based stack class implementations from the same class 
header.

Detailed:

Two different array based stack class implementations from the same class 
header, one where the top stays at the same index and the rest of the stack
moves and another where the top moves, building from the lowest index upward.
Folders Stack1 and Stack2 contain the projects in their entirety.
