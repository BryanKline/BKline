Binary Search Tree Display

Brief:

Class header and implementation for templated binary search tree with the
added ability to print the contents of the tree in the form of a tree.

Detailed:

Class header and implementation for a templated binary search tree which 
supports basic operations such as adding, insertion, removal, searching, 
and different traversals (preorder, in order, post order), an overloaded
assignment operator, all done with recursion, as well as supporting methods
to get the height and to print the structure of the tree to the screen in the 
form of a tree.  Folder PA07 contains the entire project.
