Binary Search Trees

Brief:

Two implementations of binary search trees, one basic, the other an extension
of that to display the data as a tree to the screen.

Detailed:

The two folders in this directory contain two projects dealing with binary 
search trees, one with a simple (Simple) implementation and the other (Display),
which uses the tree class from the first project along with additional methods,  
to displays its contents to terminal in the form of a tree.

The purpose of the first project is to establish basic knowledge with binary search 
trees and the second to develop more involved topics involved with trees such as 
height, depth, calculating leaf counts based on level, and other tree properties.
