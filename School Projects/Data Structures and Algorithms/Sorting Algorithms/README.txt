Sorting Algorithms

Brief:

Class header and implementation files for recursive bubble sort, merge sort, and 
quick sort algorithms. 

Detailed:

Class header and implementation files for a templated class (SorterClass) that 
inherits from a vector class (SimpleVector) which sorts its data using a virtual
method that is implemented with recursive bubble sort, merge sort, and quick 
sort algorithms.  Folder PA05 contains the entire project.
