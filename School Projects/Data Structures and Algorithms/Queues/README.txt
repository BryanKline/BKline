Queues

Brief:

Folders contain two different types of queue implementations, array
based and node based.

Detailed:

The folders contain two different queue implementations, array based
and node based.  The array based has itself two different implementations,
one where the front of the queue moves towards the back and wraps around 
back to the start of the array the other where the front stays put.  The 
node based queue also has two different implementations, both being 
essentially linked lists.  All implementations support enqueue and 
dequeue as well as overloaded operators for assignment.
