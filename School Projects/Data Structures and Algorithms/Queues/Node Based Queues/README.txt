Node Based Queues

Brief:

Folders contain two different types of node base queue implementations, the
difference being that one is templated.

Detailed:

The folders contain two different node base queue implementations.  The 
main differences between the two are that they were created for different
classes, CS202 and CS302, and one of them (CS302) is templated.  Both are 
essentially linked lists and both implementations support enqueue and 
dequeue as well as overloaded operators for assignment.
