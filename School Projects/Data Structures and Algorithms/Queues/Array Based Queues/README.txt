Array Based Queues

Brief:

Two different array based queue class implementations from the same class 
header.

Detailed:

Two different array based queue class implementations from the same class 
header, one where the front stays at the same index and the rest of the queue
moves and another where the front moves towards the back, wrapping around back 
to the start of the array when it reaches the end.  Folders Queue1 and Queue2 
contain the projects in their entirety.
