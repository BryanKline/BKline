Interfaces and Iterators

Brief:

Class headers and implementation files for a templated interface class 
with iterators. 

Detailed:

Class headers and implementation files for a templated interface class 
with iterators; the interface class inherits from a templated linked list 
(LinkedList) and implements iterators to move through the linked list 
with increment and decrement operators and to access the items in the list 
with a dereference operator, all implemented as virtual methods.  Folder 
PA04 contains the entire project.
