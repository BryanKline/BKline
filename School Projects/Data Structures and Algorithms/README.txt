Data Structures and Algorithms

Brief:

Folders contain class headers and implementation for common data structures
and algorithms, produced for school assignments.

Detailed:

Folders contain class headers and implementation files for various data
structures and algorithms which were produced as assignments for CS202 
and CS302, Object Oriented Programming and Data Structures and Algorithms,
respectively.

The folders contain at the top level the class headers and implementation
files and another file which contains the project in its entirety, including
all supporting classes, the main driver, the makefile and input files for 
testing.

The class header, supporting classes, and the main driver for each project 
were typically provided by the instructor and the implementation for the 
data structure that was the focus of the project was written by me.  

It is for ease of perusal that only the class that I wrote is at
the top most level in each directory and upon drilling down can the
whole project be seen.  All code produced for CS302 was commented and
formatted in accordance with a particular standard and most folders include
Doxygen documentation.  All code is written in C++.
