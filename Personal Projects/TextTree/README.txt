Detailed:

The folders contain implementations of the TextTree data structure in both
C++ and Java.  The C++ version is for initial design and testing and the Java 
version uses the TextTree class as a data structure for a Java Swing GUI 
application.  

The TextTree class is a tree structure where any node many have any number of
child nodes and each one holds label and content strings.  The purpose is to
provide a structure which can hold textual data, the content, and to tie a
label or meaning to that data, its label, which is arranged hierarchically. 

The Java Swing application uses the TextTree class to store textual information
in a tree which is represented in a window, providing functionality for adding and
removing nodes, searching for nodes labels, as well as editing the label and content
of the nodes, all as buttons and text fields.  The purpose of the application is to
provide a place to store text in a structured manner, whether for notes, programming 
syntax, writing samples, equations, or other information, whose label can be easily 
searched and the content quickly retrieved.
